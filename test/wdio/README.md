   version compatible with the version of Chrome running in your Android device.
   If `appium` has already been installed with an incompatible `chromedriver`
   version, you might want to uninstall and reinstall it with the proper
   `--chromedriver_version` argument.

6. Start `appium` with the provided helper script:
   ```sh
   bin/appium.sh
   ```

7. Start the Android Virtual Device with a custom `/etc/hosts` file:

   To run the tests in landscape orientation, provide the `ORIENTATION`
   environment variable:
   ```sh
   ORIENTATION=LANDSCAPE docker-compose run --rm wdio mobile-chrome
   ```

### Internet Explorer
**Please Note:**  
This guide assumes that a system with Windows 10 has been set up, e.g. using the
"MSEdge on Win10" virtual machine image (which also includes Internet Explorer)
from
[Microsoft's Free VMs](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)
site.

To run the tests with Internet Explorer, follow these steps:

1. Set "Change the size of text, apps, and other items" to 100% in Windows
   Display Settings.  
   If the option is grayed out, make sure the graphics configuration allows
   changing the scaling setting (see e.g.
   [Parallels article #123951](https://kb.parallels.com/en/123951)).

2. Make sure the Internet Explorer `Zoom` level is set to `100%` so that
   the native mouse events can be set to the correct coordinates.

3. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as
   [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
   and add the following environment variables:
   ```sh
   SERVER_HOST=<DOCKER_HOST_IP>
   SERVER_PORT=8443
   WINDOWS_HOST=<WINDOWS_HOST_IP>
   WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR=C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Desktop\assets\
   ```
   Make sure that the `DOCKER_HOST_IP` is accessible from the Windows machine
   and the `WINDOWS_HOST_IP` is accessible from a Docker container (see also the
   [FAQ](FAQ.md)).  
   Also make sure that `WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR` points to a valid folder path and
   ends with a backslash.

4. Edit the `example` host entry in [etc/windows.hosts](etc/windows.hosts) and
   set its IP address to the `SERVER_HOST` IP defined in the `.env` file.

5. Copy [bin/webdriver.ps1](bin/webdriver.ps1) and
   [etc/windows.hosts](etc/windows.hosts) to the same folder in the Windows
   machine (e.g. the Desktop).  
   Also copy the files in the `assets` directory to the folder defined as
   `WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR`.

6. Create a shortcut to `webdriver.ps1` (via "Right-Click" → "Create shortcut"),
   then open the properties dialog for the shortcut (via "Right-Click" →
   "Properties") and set the `Target` property to the following value:
   ```bat
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File webdriver.ps1
   ```
   Click "OK" to save the changes to the shortcut.

7. Double-Click on the webdriver shortcut to setup and start the servers.  
   Allow `nginx` and `MJPEGServer` to communicate on all networks in the Windows
   Defender Firewall dialog.

8. Run the tests with Internet Explorer:
   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm wdio ie
   ```

### Microsoft Edge
**Please Note:**  
This guide assumes that a system with Windows 10 has been set up.  
The scripted installation of
[MicrosoftWebDriver](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/)
also requires `17763` as minimum Windows build version.

To run the tests with Microsoft Edge, follow these steps:

1. Create a `.env` file in the same directory as
   [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml)
   and add the following environment variables:
   ```sh
   SERVER_HOST=<DOCKER_HOST_IP>
   SERVER_PORT=8443
   WINDOWS_HOST=<WINDOWS_HOST_IP>
   WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR=C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Desktop\assets\
   ```
   Make sure that the `DOCKER_HOST_IP` is accessible from the Windows machine
   and the `WINDOWS_HOST_IP` is accessible from a Docker container (see also the
   [FAQ](FAQ.md)).  
   Also make sure that `WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR` points to a valid folder path and
   ends with a backslash.

2. Edit the `example` host entry in [etc/windows.hosts](etc/windows.hosts) and
   set its IP address to the `SERVER_HOST` IP defined in the `.env` file.

3. Copy [bin/webdriver.ps1](bin/webdriver.ps1) and
   [etc/windows.hosts](etc/windows.hosts) to the same folder in the Windows
   machine (e.g. the Desktop).  
   Also copy the files in the `assets` directory to the folder defined as
   `WINDOWS_ASSETS_DIR`.

4. Create a shortcut to `webdriver.ps1` (via "Right-Click" → "Create shortcut"),
   then open the properties dialog for the shortcut (via "Right-Click" →
   "Properties") and set the `Target` property to the following value:
   ```bat
   powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -File webdriver.ps1
   ```
   Click "OK" to save the changes to the shortcut.

5. Double-Click on the webdriver shortcut to setup and start the servers.  
   Allow `nginx` and `MJPEGServer` to communicate on all networks in the Windows
   Defender Firewall dialog.

6. Run the tests with Microsoft Edge:
   ```sh
   docker-compose run --rm wdio edge
   ```

### Shutdown
Stop and remove the container set:
```sh
docker-compose down -v
```
